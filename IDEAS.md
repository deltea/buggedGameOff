## Storyline

*The player, a spy, tries to infiltrate enemy headquarters to collect an important paper because the spys agency hears a lot of suspicious chatter. The spy goes through the building, and tries to get to the top, where the spy thinks the headquarters are. The spy has to pass guards and locked doors to get to the top. To open locked doors, the spy has to attach bugs to the patrol guards to gather information about the doors. The spy also has to pass guards without being seen. You can attach the bugs to the guards by shooting the bug onto the guards back when they're not looking using a bug shooter. You have to collect bugs hidden in the building to use them. You can use them up. When the spy finally gets to the top, he figures out it was actually a trap, and the boss of the evil organization was waiting at the top. To defeat the boss once and for all, you have to attach bugs at various enemys and wait for them to tell which combination of keys to press to deal damage to the boss. After you defeat the boss, you collect the paper and a congragulation sound plays, but as the spy was celebrating, a strong wind sweeps in and blows the paper outside, and it is lst. Lost forever. THE END.*
